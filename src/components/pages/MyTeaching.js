  Teach Chess in 8 Steps
  <br />
    1) The set-up of a chess board.
    <br />
    <br />
    2) How do the pieces move/function.
    <br />
    <br />
    3) The eight technical ways to end a chess game- 
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Win/Lose: Checkmate, Resignation, or Timeout.
        <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Draw: Stalemate, Insufficient material, 50 move-rule, Three-fold repetition, or an Agreement.
        <br />
        <br />
    4) The two ways to get out of check: 
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill: the threating piece with the king or another piece.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move: the king away or move another piece to block the threat.   
    <br />
    <br />
    5) Basic strategy: Protection, Traps, Forks, Sacrifice, Counter-attack, Tempo, Pin, Etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    6) Advanced piece movement: Castling, en passant' capture, Pawn two square advance.
    <br />
    <br />
    7) Now for an actual game, test your opponent by playing every game as “White” and using the “Fried Liver Attack” variation opening. The goal is to repeat this until they realize/find a way to stop it. Do this until they win a game.
    <br />
    <br />
    8) Advanced strategy: Thinking 2-3  moves ahead, Pattern learning/knowing the Lines, Openings, Endings.
    <br />
    <br />
