  Hi, my name is Jordan Dains. 
  <br />
  I am the creator of Iron Chess and are glad that you clicked on my site. 
  <br />
  I would also like to shout out to some contributors to the creation of Iron Chess.
  <br />
  Notably, Dane Dawson, Alex Rios, & the goat Andres H for helping with my biggest program error.
