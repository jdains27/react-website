Ways to Play Chess
<br />
    Standard: Classical | Blitz | Rapid 
    <br />
    Challenges: There are many ways to play challenges, in amount of moves, time, or best move possible. The challenge/goal is different based on how the creator sets it up.
    <br />
    Chess Engine: AI's or artificial intelligence that learn chess and play it.
    <br />
    Interdimensional Chess: Super complicated, I don't even fully understand it. Recommend looking up the rules.
    <br />
    4 Player Chess: A special board made of standard 8Ã—8 squares with an additional 3 rows of 8 cells extending from each side is common.
    <br />
    Redemption Chess: Play a normal game and for every piece lost in the orginal gets moved to the redemption game (in the starting position). The goal is to test your skills and try to win both games.
    <br />
    Fog of War: The board starts off blank, the only way to see other pieces is the movement and attack square a piece produces.
